LOGO PLACEHOLDER
================

To complete your East Prussian Roblox Community website, please:

1. Copy your logo file "C:\Users\ironw\Downloads\asdascc b.png" to this directory
2. Rename it to "logo.png"
3. Also create a smaller version (32x32 pixels) named "favicon.png" for the browser tab icon

The website is currently set up to use:
- logo.png (for the main logo in navigation and footer)
- favicon.png (for the browser tab icon)

Both files should be in PNG format for best compatibility.

Current logo references in the code:
- Navigation bar logo
- Footer logo
- Favicon in browser tab

The website will work without these files, but will show broken image icons until you add them.
